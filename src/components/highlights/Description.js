          Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is that we get to experience it all—every
          beautifully incredible album in one moment of time. Taylor Swift’s
          Eras Tour is a cultural phenomenon. With unprecedented demand, smashed
          world records and a staggering 44-song setlist, the Eras tour spans
          Swift’s entire discography, chronicling all the various eras and
          albums of the Midnights singer’s career. From the mad scramble to buy
          tickets that crashed Ticketmaster’s website to guest appearances from
          the likes of Taylor Lautner, Joey King, Haim and Phoebe Bridgers,
          Swift brings new surprises for her fans at each stop.And sometimes,
          while you’re sardined in a large arena, you look around and realize
          that what you’re witnessing is history in the making. That’s what
          Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is—history. It’s indescribable, incandescent
          magic.
